### SELEX results directory

Inside the results directory, each value of K gets its own reults directory for each SELEX round.

Inside each rNkN folder, the: cooccurence distace, hamming distance, forward and reverse logo, position distribution distance, and a preproc.pickle for the corresponding round and K value are saved.

The main reults directory also contains a folder for the trend figure reults.

There are also two sets of reults pages which separate the results by round (ie. show all values of K for a single round) and by K value (show all rounds for a single value of K).
