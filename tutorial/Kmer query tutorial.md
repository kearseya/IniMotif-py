### Kmer query
Kmer query allows the user to input a list of kmers (same length) and have their counts returned to them in plain text as an output. If the data used is from SELEX, only the counts from one round will be returned

Similar to the Top kmer tab, the Kmer query tab on requires two entries: a preproc.pickle file, and input kmers (one per line).
